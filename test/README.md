# Testable Documentation

Testable docs are a good thing -- documentation that isn't true is pretty much useless.

The files in this directory implements that.

## Checking for dead links

The `check-links.sh` script checks for dead links in the site. If the script exits without error, all checked links are live.

## Validating Schemas

Schemas are validated with the `check-schemas.sh` script. If the script exits without error, the schemas all validated.
