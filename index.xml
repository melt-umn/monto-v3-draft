      <description>The Monto Version 3 protocol differs from Version 2 in several ways.
HTTP/2 instead of ZeroMQ ZeroMQ requires FFI, which is difficult in some editors and requires an additional dependency in all. For example, to implement monto-mode, a Monto major mode for emacs, the author needed to depend on elisp-ffi, a package that provides FFI for Emacs by spawning a subprocess and communicating with a custom protocol over pipes. Needless to say, this is horrible and inefficient.</description>

      <description>Abstract This specification describes an improved iteration of the Monto protocol for Disintegrated Development Environments ([MONTO]) . These improvements allow for simpler implementations for Clients. They also make it feasible to have multiple Clients sharing a single Service, and for Services to be operated over the Internet (rather than on the local network or on a single machine).

      <title>Overview, Justifications, and FAQs</title>

      <description>Note: This document has some overlap with the Differences document; read that too.
Overview of Monto 3 Monto 3 is split into two &amp;ldquo;subprotocols,&amp;rdquo; the Client Protocol and the Service Protocol. This is done so that changes and extensions can be made to each one individually.
For example, adding multi-user caching for services to the specification requires no differences in the Client Protocol, so it does not require bumping the Client Protocol version number.</description>
